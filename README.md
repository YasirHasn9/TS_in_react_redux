# TS_in_react_redux
## Practicing Typescript with React/Redux 
### The benefits/pros of using TS with ReRe --> React/Redux ;)?
1. easier to find the common typos
2. better understanding of the flowing data around the app
3. easier to refactor
--------------------
** Note **
When using a pure js in redux with react we cant catch the error right and also if we want to change something we have to change it manually.
with TS , we can easily spot the error in our editor because we are gonna get notations telling us where we need to make a change    



### The cons of TS ?
1. not the best type definition 
2. tons of generic 
3. tons of imports
4. Redux inherently functional in nature, tough integration with TS classes.
